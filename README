SimpleLTC Web Mining Framework

Requirements:
SimpleLTC relies on an existing and working litecoin and pushpool installation. Before attempting to run simplecoin, please setup the following.
Litecoin: https://litecoin.org/
Pushpool: https://github.com/ArtForz/pushpool

Installation:
1. Extract files into web root directory
2. Create simplecoin database in you mysql instance
3. Run simplecoin.sql in your simplecoin database (This will be used for pushpool & simplcoin)
4. Edit includes/requiredFunctions.php and set the bitcoin & database login info
5. Edit all files in the cronjob folder, set $includesDirectory to the correct server path.
6. setup cronjobs on a staggered schedule. I recommend 10-30 minutes for most. I run payout twice daily.

This fork makes aesthetic changes to make the interface LTC friendly, and tweaks the hashrate algorithm accordingly.
